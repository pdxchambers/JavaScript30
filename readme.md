# JavaScript30 Solutions

## Description
I'm working through the [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) course [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) as part of my personal challenge I'm calling 
the 2020 Code Kata Challenge. The challenge was inspired by the 100 days of code challenge where you commit to coding once a day for 100 days. I decided 
I wanted to learn native JavaScript, no libraries, no frameworks, just the basic ES6 standard JavaScript, but instead of doing 100 days of code I decided 
to do 100 Code Kata in 2020. I've posted a [full list](https://pdxchambers.com/2020-code-kata-challenge/) of my kata on my [website](https://www.pdxchambers.com).

### Day 1 - Drum Kit
This lesson involved binding key presses to sounds and focused on key and transition events. The interface is simple, a list of buttons that, when the corresponding key is pressed, produces a sound like a bass drum, hand clap, or cymbal strike.

### Day 2 - CSS + JavaScript Clock
The lesson for Day 2 was to animate an analog clock rendered in HTML/CSS. It performs the initial positioning of the hands in CSS, but then using JavaScript to update the hand position based on the current time.
